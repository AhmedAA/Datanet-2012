\subsection{Store and Forward}
\subsubsection{Processing and delay}
One of the main reasons for delay in packet switched networks is the output
buffer. If the output buffer becomes full, the router, or switch, begins to drop
the packets, resulting in a delay. This is also called ``packet loss''. Another
reason is store-and-forward.
