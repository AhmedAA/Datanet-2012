\subsection{Question 1}
The peer client needs 2 sockets, a client socket connected to the name server,
and a client socket in listen mode. One could argue that a third socket for
client input is also needed, but since this isn't a socket that needs to be
opened or treated in any way it is not counted in.

\subsection{Question 2}
The choice to use a buffer size, limits the message size, this could be
prevented by using a special token, on the other hand a special token would
prevent users from using this token in their messages. So the ideal solution
would be to use a combination of tokens, this could be ``CRLF;CRLF;'', this
would allow people to use a single new line, but not multiple.
