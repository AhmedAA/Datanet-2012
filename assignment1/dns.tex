\subsection{DNS}
\subsubsection{DNS Provisions}
DNS has been built from the ground up to be distributed, across a hierarchy of organized servers around
the world. Re-ordering of IP addresses on each request allow a simple form of round-robin \textbf{load
balancing}, and because requests can return NS-type records which must then be asked in turn, it becomes
easy for both root-level, TLD, authoritative and local DNS servers to provide load-balancing.
\textbf{Effeciency} is achieved through re-directing requests to more local DNS servers, combined with 
the very crucial ability to cache request mappings. In addition, the DNS message format can contain a
variable number of resource records (RRs), so a single DNS request will be enough to decide which next
DNS server to approach, or to receive a list of RRs with type A/MX/CNAME.
