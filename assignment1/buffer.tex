\section{Buffers and latency}
\textbf{Part 1}\\
First, we recalculate the packet size to bits:
\[
512 \cdot 8 \cdot 10^6 = 4096000 bits
\]
Then we recalculate the link speed to bits per second:
\[
2.048 \cdot 1000 = 2048000 bits/sec
\]
We quickly see that $\frac{4096000}{2048000} = 2$, so the maximum buffer delay
would be 2 seconds.
